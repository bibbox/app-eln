# app-eln - Electronic (Laboratory) Notebook
The Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN), designed first to replace the Paper Laboratory Notebook, is also an easy and useful way to keep notes of your daily work whether it's laboratory related or not. It is adapted to everyone: biologist, epidemiologist, statistician, IT developers, ... and is an easy way to share secure information with colleagues.

The ELN is based on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). It contains a child theme of [Atahualpa](https://wordpress.org/themes/atahualpa/) and a plugin, **IARC Customization**, that personalizes WordPress and some plugins used by the ELN. It has been tested with WordPress 4.9.2
